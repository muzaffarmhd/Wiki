HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It is a fundamental technology in web development and acts as the backbone for building web pages. Here's an overview of HTML:







## Structure of HTML







HTML documents are made up of elements, which are enclosed in tags. Each element is responsible for defining different parts of a web page. The basic structure of an HTML document includes:







- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version.







- `<html>`: The root element that encloses the entire HTML document.







- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title, character encoding, and links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts.







- `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.







- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, and more.







## HTML Elements







HTML provides a wide range of elements to structure content. Some commonly used HTML elements include:







- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, ... `<h6>`: Headings that define the hierarchy and importance of text.







- `<p>`: Paragraphs to organize and separate text.







- `<a>`: Anchor tags for creating hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.







- `<img>`: Images for displaying graphics and visuals.







- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`: Lists, both unordered and ordered, to organize information.







- `<div>` and `<span>`: Generic container elements used for grouping and styling content.







## Attributes







HTML elements can also have attributes, which provide additional information or properties for elements. For example:







- `src` for specifying the source of an image (`<img src="image.jpg">`).



- `href` for defining the destination of a hyperlink (`<a href="https://www.example.com">Link</a>`).



- `class` and `id` for adding [CSS](/wiki/CSS) and JavaScript hooks to elements.







## HTML and Web Development







HTML is just one part of web development. It provides the structure and content for web pages. To enhance the visual and interactive aspects of web pages, [CSS](/wiki/CSS) (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling, and JavaScript is used for interactivity and behavior. The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript forms the basis of modern web development, allowing developers to create dynamic and engaging websites and web applications.







As web technology continues to evolve, HTML also advances with new versions. HTML5, for instance, introduced many new features and elements that enhance multimedia support, form handling, and more. HTML remains an essential skill for web developers, as it lays the foundation for creating the web content we interact with on a daily basis.
